#
# Emit a configuration file with every 'include' directive replaced by the
# contents of the file(s) it names, recursively, the way Nginx itself resolves
# includes when it loads its configuration. Every parse_* function below reads
# its input through here.
#
# Without this, a server block that keeps its 'ssl_certificate' lines in an
# included snippet is invisible to certificate discovery: the snippet holds the
# certificate but no 'server_name', while the file including it holds the
# 'server_name' but no certificate, so neither half parses on its own. Splitting
# vhosts into shared snippets is a common Nginx layout, and it silently disabled
# renewal for every certificate declared that way.
#
# Relative include paths resolve against the Nginx prefix. Globs are expanded,
# and a quoted path containing spaces resolves correctly. An include matching
# nothing is skipped rather than fatal, since Nginx tolerates an empty glob and
# a cosmetic config problem must not become a failed renewal.
#
# Where this deliberately differs from Nginx — all inherited from the line-based
# parsing the parse_* functions have always used:
#   - 'include' must begin the line; a directive sharing the line ahead of it is
#     not seen.
#   - the terminating ';' must be on the same line as the 'include'.
#   - anything following that ';' on the same line is dropped with it.
#
# An include whose target certificate discovery ALREADY scans on its own is not
# inlined. Everything matching '*.conf*' under the conf.d directory is parsed as
# a configuration in its own right, so inlining it here would fuse its
# certificates with this file's server names and vice versa — 'parse_config_file'
# pairs every certificate in its input with every domain in it. An aggregating
# layout such as 'include conf.d/sites/*.conf;' would then request every site's
# hostnames on every site's certificate. Snippets are the case this function
# exists for, and a snippet is precisely a file discovery does NOT scan alone.
